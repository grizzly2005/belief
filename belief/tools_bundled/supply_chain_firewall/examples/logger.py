"""
Users of Supply-Chain Firewall may want to use custom loggers according to their
own logging needs.  This module contains a template for writing a custom logger.

Supply-Chain Firewall discovers loggers at runtime via the following simple protocol.
The module implementing the custom logger must contain a function with the following
name and signature:

```
def load_logger() -> FirewallLogger
```

This `load_logger` function should return an instance of the custom logger for
Supply-Chain Firewall's use. The module may then be placed in the `scfw/loggers`
directory for runtime import, no further modification required. Make sure to reinstall
the `scfw` package after doing so.
